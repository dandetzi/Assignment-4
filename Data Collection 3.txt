How do competing policy entrepreneurs within the US decision-making process promote defense strategies that address China?

Main arguments (theories/hypotheses): Competing policy networks within the US civil-military structure vie for influence 
within the defense decision-making process to shape defense strategy. The organizations or individuals (positions) 
that win influence will alternate during each decision-making iteration, thus creating a variation in strategies (or at least in public messaging
of that strategy).

Hypothesis: Periods of "saber rattling" with China will create an opportunity for competing camps (strategy entrepreneurs) within the US government 
to promote their preferences in public.

Similar to the wartime strategies in previous iterations, in this case I would like to see if policy (strategy) entrepreneurs are the same individuals with 
similar networks, or if there are different networks that form to devise strategy in a different venue (counterinsurgency vs. conventional/great power
competition). 

Data collection is the same process: looking for the networks that appear following diplomatic/security crises with China.
